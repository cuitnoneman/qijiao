如果在某次大灾难中，所有的科学知识都将被毁灭，只有一句话能够传给下一代人，那么，怎样的说法能够以最少的词汇包含最多的信息呢？我相信那就是原子假说（或原子事实，或随便你叫它什么名字），即万物都由原子构成，原子是一些小粒子，它们永不信息地四下运动，当它们分开一个小距离时彼此吸引，而被挤到一堆时则相互排斥。只要稍微一想，你就会看到，在这句话里包含关于这个世界的极大量的信息。   费曼讲物理入门 1-2 P.4
1–2 Matter is made of atoms
If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is the atomic hypothesis (or the atomic fact, or whatever you wish to call it) that all things are made of atoms—little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. In that one sentence, you will see, there is an enormous amount of information about the world, if just a little imagination and thinking are applied.
